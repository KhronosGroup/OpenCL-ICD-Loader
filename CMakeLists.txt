# The option below allows building the ICD Loader library as a shared library
# (ON, default) or a static library (OFF).
#
# Khronos OpenCL Working Group strongly recommends building and using the ICD
# loader as a shared library due to the following benefits:
#
# 1. The shared library can be updated independent of the application. This
#    allows releasing new fixes and features in the ICD loader without updating
#    the application.
#
#    In rare cases when there are backward-incompatible changes to the ICD
#    loader (due to platform requirements, for instance), using a shared
#    library allows updating the library to make the transition seamless to
#    installed applications.
#
# 2. On platforms that require the ICD mechanism there are multiple vendors
#    shipping their OpenCL implementations. The vendor installers collaborate
#    to make sure that the installed ICD shared library version is suitable for
#    working with all vendor implementations installed on the system.
#
#    If applications statically link to ICD Loader then that version of the ICD
#    loader may not work with one or more installed vendor implementations.
#
# Using the OpenCL ICD loader as a static library is NOT recommended for
# end-user installations in general. However in some controlled environments it
# may be useful to simplify the build and distribution of the application. E.g.
# in test farms, or in cases where the end-user system configs are known in
# advance. Use it with discretion.
